# Architecture Decision Records

As per [Michael Nygard's article](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)

## Recommended tooling

I highly recommend picking up [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) if you plan to work within a repository, or plain text, as it automates a lot of pain away.
