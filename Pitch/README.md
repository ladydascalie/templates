# Pitch

At Basecamp, there is a six-weeks fixed cycle in product development. At each cycle, people will be either preparing, planning and researching the work to be done on the next cycle or they will be implementing the work that was panned and researched on the previous cycle. The formal document that describes the problem, the solution and the work that needs to be done is called Pitch. This is different that a Product Requirements template since this document will be put under another stage, Betting, where they will evaluate all of the Pitches and decide which one to proceed with on the next cycle.
